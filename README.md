Hi, I’m @5239510B
I'm doing adult education & learning code is part of it. 
Very much a new baby coder- I’m currently learning to use Unity & Python
I’m looking to collaborate on nothing right now
I wasn't aware the course had so much math. 
Pronouns: she/her
⚡ Fun fact: my lecturer hadn't heard of a ZX Spectrum because my first computer came out before they were born
